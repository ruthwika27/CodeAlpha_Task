# 📧 Email Extractor – CodeAlpha Python Internship (Task 3)

## 📌 Project Overview
This is **Task 3** of my **CodeAlpha Python Programming Internship** – an **Email Extractor Script** 
that automates the process of finding and saving all valid email addresses from a given text file.

The script uses **Regular Expressions (Regex)** to identify email patterns, removes duplicates, 
sorts the list, and saves the results into a separate file.
